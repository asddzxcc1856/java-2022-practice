3.5 new keyword is used to create an instance of the class and call class's constructor to initialize the object.

3.6
public class ex3_6 {
	private double x,y;
	public ex3_6(double x,double y)
	{
		this.x = x;
		this.y = y;
	}
	public ex3_6()
	{
		x = 0.0;
		y = 0.0;
	}
}

3.7 class have instance variable,and each object of class must maintain information seperately from all other objects.

3.8 System and String are both in the java.lang, which is implicitly imported into java source-code file.

3.9 every use of a class's name in a program is fully qualified,there is no need to import the class.(ex: java.util.Scanner)

3.10 if instance variable is private variable,we could not get a private variable value and assign a value to instance variable for an object of class.
